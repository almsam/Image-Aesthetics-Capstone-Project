# Weekly Team Log


## Date Range:

- Week 12 - Week 14
- [24/11/2024] - [8/12/2024]

## Features in the Project Plan Cycle:

1. UI update:  After Milestone 1 we knew what to update and where we had to improve, so I tried improving UI to more efficiently  suit the clients needs. Updated UI and added a bunch of new pages through which we can expand our webapp's functionality.
2. Created new pages for new: Created a page where users can edit and update their survey information. Also, updated the rate-images page to now compare imagesets which include two images side by side of which one is picked by the user as the more aesthetic image. Added a question for parameters and added a rate-images quiz/experiment.
3. Backend Functions: Various functions which allow us to fetch/insert data into the different databases have been created. Also various edit data functions have also been added to the backend functions.
4. Machine learning improvements: use a variety of mathematical & data science techniques should allow a much lower error with the CNN.
5. [Add more here]

## Test Report / Testing Status:

All tests for features added this sprint are passing.

## Overview:

Post-Milestone 2, the team is now focused on improving and editing our work to more appropriately fit the needs of our client. Before M3 we aim to nullify any shortcomings we have had for M2, additionally now we will focus on M3 requirements as well. Now that we're in the final term for the project, we have a solid idea of what all is to be done in the next sprint. This week's features include updated UI, updated and new backend functionality, and session management. The Kanban Board has been populated with tasks and through this week more tasks will be added as we brainstorm for the Milestone 3. The next cycle will focus on creating improvements for our webapp, nullifying shortcomings, and Milestone 3 requirements.
