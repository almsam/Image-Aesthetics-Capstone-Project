### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

I did 4 tasks myself & helped my team with one, I expanded on my surrogate models & used them on my data flow - ultimately I am satisfied that I managed to get a successful EDA done on what we have built

Team continues plays nice despite Zoe dropping out. We saved the momentum & recovered the progress - so hopefully lets sail smoothly to the end of the term

### Goals For Next Iteration
3 issues:
* revise & improove the experiment
* fix the data analysis for the professors entry
* image quality fpr experiment
