### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Docker has been a problem for a long time and I have managed to make big progess successfully. The build runs in under a minute, and the frontend container is working now. There is a small bug in backend container that I hope to clear soon. Technically, task 2 has been dropped as it has been overruled by another PR, but the code written previously served as a baseline. I am currently working on task 3 and will make a PR within 24-48 hours. Finals are coming close and I havent done as much work as previous iterations.
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Update surveyAPI with additional features  like   deleting and getting survey data.
  * Remake tables in db as there are a few deprecated tables.
  * Might require an overhaul of project structure as there are unused files and file structure is weird.
