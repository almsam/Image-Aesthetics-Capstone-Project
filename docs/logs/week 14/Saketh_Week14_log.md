## Sunday (8th December 2024)



### Current Tasks (Provide sufficient detail)
  * #1 :Implement summary of experiment at end : Basic python code to calculate percentage of users who chose an img is done. 
  * #2 : Remake tables in db: Updating tables.
  * #3: Fix docker errors: All docker related issues were fixed as stressful and time-consuming as it was, however there is just one small error in initialising the backend via docker which is currently being worked on.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Task A is in progress and will be done soon, Task B we are still deciding on it, Task C, we spent almost 2 weeks on, completing 95 percent of the docker implementation, and getting the frontend running via docker. Just one small issue is arrising from the backend connection to docker for which we will meet with a TA and complete within the next 2-3 days. Shakthi, Devstutya and I worked on docker together.

Team has managed nicely despite Zoe dropping out. We saved the momentum & recovered the progress.
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * As mentioned for the Tasks that have not been fully completed yet will be needing my attention.
