## Sunday (16th February 2025)



### Current Tasks (Provide sufficient detail)
  * #1 : Image Gen Ratings  : Create an API endpoint to update the backend with the Ratings for each generated image on the image gen page.
  * #2 : Results Page Bug: The images fetched and displayed on the results page are the incorrect images and aren't chosen by the user. We need to look at the API endpoint and see if all is working, and the frontend needs to be checked to see if the endpoint is being used correctly. This bug needs to be fixed this iteration.
  * #3 : User Access : Experiment can only be accessed after survey is completed.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
All the tasks have been done with the help of the APIs made for it's functionality

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Would be discussing future requirements and getting them done over the next few days
