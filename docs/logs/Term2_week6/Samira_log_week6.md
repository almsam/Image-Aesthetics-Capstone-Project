I did 4 & successfully acomplished M3's ML critera - I am happy with most all of this short of my 3 teammates taking almost all the presentation time

Team plays nice but I still suspect my 3 colleagues are burnt out from all the work. If they can rest a bit duirng the 3 week iteration I think we'll be fine

### Goals For Next Iteration

2 issues:

* #235: double pixel smoothing - cascade the smoothing method twice
* #236: quality smoothing - improve image resolution
