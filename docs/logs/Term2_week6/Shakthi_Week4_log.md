### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Unfortunately, I couldnt dedicate a lot of time to capstone work this iteration as i was packed with midterms and assignments. Additionally, deployment took a lot more time than expected and we will need to push it to nex iteration. But I must say fixing docker was a huge task as we were stuck on it since the beginning of capstone.
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Proper Session Management
  * Deployment
