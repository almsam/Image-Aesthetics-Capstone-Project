### Current Tasks (Provide sufficient detail)
  * #1: Updated image comparison quiz: After Milestone 2 we knew what to update and where we had to improve, so I tried improving UI to more efficiently  suit the clients needs. Specifically after M2 we noticed we needed to update our survey and ensure that users could only see 1 question and choose to go to the prev/next one instead of displaying all questions immediately on the same page.
  * #2: Created Edit-survey info page: Created a page where users can edit and update their survey information.
  * #3 Fixed multi-language bug: A bug which changed language back to default english after navigating to a different page was also fixed in thi iteration.
  * #4: Fix docker errors: All docker related issues were fixed as stressful and time-consuming as it was, however there is just one small error in initialising the backend via docker which is currently being worked on.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I completed Task A, B, and C as planned. Task D, we spent almost 2 weeks on, completing 95 percent of the docker implementation, and getting the frontend running via docker. Just one small issue is arrising from the backend connection to docker for which we will meet with a TA and complete within the next 2-3 days. Also, since shakthi, skaeth and I worked on docker together most of the commits are from their github which is why it may seem like I have lesser issues this week.
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Goal 1: Add more pages on the admin side, to increase completed admin features
  * Goal 2: Implement functionality to the frontend of the experiment summary with visaulisations.
  * Goal 3: Fix Docker's backend connection
  * Goal 4: Implement CI/CD
