### Current Tasks

  * #2: Experiment Summary: Created method to calculate percent of users who chose the same image as the primary user and send the data to frontend where it can be displayed visually.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Overall we had a decently productive week in my opinion. I planned on getting 3 issues done this iteration but I was sick over the winter break and the first week of January so my performance was quite restricted.
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Update tables as some of the data is obsolete
  * General bug fixing and additional features
