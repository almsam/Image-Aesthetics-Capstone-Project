### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

Did both tasks, I got data from https://github.com/EN10/CIFAR & downloaded it to the repo. The next task was to ensure the images were view able, to which 3/5 of us can now access the images. Everything went smoothly & the team is playing nicely. PR's are also very quick to be reviewed & merged (& bugs fixed quickly)

### Goals For Next Iteration
2 issues: 1 is get tensorflow to read the images & work on them, & the other is to recall my previous image processing experience to begin machine learning
