# Weekly Team Log


## Date Range:

- Week 3 - Week 5
- [22/09/2024] - [6/10/2024]

## Features in the Project Plan Cycle:

1. Frontend launch: Initial setup, so that functionality can start being implemented from the next sprint onwards
2. User Database setup: Using SQLite we have created a user database which will include the admin and standard users (in different tables).
3. Image Database setup: Created a db which stores images, questions, users, and ratings. This will also be used to store information on the users and the ratings they give each image based on the question provided. 
4. Backend Functions: Various functions which allow us to fetch/insert data into the different databases have been created.  
5. Started exploring machine learning and image processing tools to start looking into the algorithms mentioned in the project descriptions ( one algorithm (possibly using heuristics or generative AI or other methods) should be developed to generate pairs or sets of images that could be added to the database, and another algorithm (possibly using heuristics, machine learning, or other methods) should be developed to automatically determine which of a set of images is most aesthetically pleasing)

## Test Report / Testing Status:

All tests for features added this sprint are passing.

## Overview:

The team focused on the initial steps of the frontend and backend development for the project. The Kanban Board has been populated with tasks, milestones have been added, and the dashboard visuals creation has been completed. The next cycle will focus on implementing functionality to our webapp and establishing a connection between our frontend and backend.
