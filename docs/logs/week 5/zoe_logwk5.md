### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Completed all tasks. Database class set up was straightforward with no issues. Everything went well and communication between the team is good regarding who is working on what and when someone needs to review something for a pull request.

### Next Cycle Goals 
Complete the system architecture and DFD designs.
Work towards having everything ready for milestone 1 presentation.
Create methods to connect to and query the image database.
