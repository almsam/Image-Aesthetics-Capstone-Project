### Current Tasks (Provide sufficient detail)
  * #1: Add experiment summary/results page: I created a page in which users can see the results of their experiment, which images they picked, and how many users picked the same images (along with a percentage)
  * #2: Updated and added admin features: Added view and export rating data functions and updated UI to allow this data to be displayed appropriately. Also added the feature to view survey data and delete specific 'bad' survey data.
  * #3: Improved UI and sidebar accessability: Sidebar has improved accessability. Additionally user and admin dashboard have been updated to look more appropriate. Fixed some UI bugs too.
  * #4: Add an exit/reset button for the users in the webapp: Users can now click exit to dashboard after view their experiment summary/results. Also on their dashboard they can click exit to homepage to exit the user dashboard.
  * $5: Updated tests: Updated frontend and e2e tests for all these major changes.
  * #6: Fix docker errors: All docker related issues were fixed as stressful and time-consuming as it was, however there is just one small error in initialising the backend via docker which is currently being worked on.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I completed all tasks as planned in this iteration and updated tests accordingly. After peer evaluation and with M3 closing in we added a lot of features to the app. Additionally UI was also heavily updated.
Task F, we spent almost 4 weeks on, completing 95 percent of the docker implementation, and getting the frontend running via docker. Just one small issue is arrising from the backend connection to docker for which we will meet with a TA and complete within the next 2-3 days. 
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Goal 1: Fix a couple session management bugs and ensure proper session management (Issue 190)
  * Goal 2: Add consent form before demographic survey
  * Goal 3: Fix Docker's backend connection
  * Goal 4: Implement CI/CD
