### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
This was a really productive iteration thanks to the peer testing that was done in class. We managed to get some great issues for the next iteration and got some key features and bug fixes done.
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Add a consent form.
  * Proper Session Management
