### Current Tasks

* #181: VAST training data - make a program & generate training data for the vast images
* #184: read CNN - make the VAST CNN savable & readable
* #187: image generation - develop an adequate image gen model
* #195: seed for img gen - image generation needs to work with seeds so we are deterministic
* #197: averaging bug fix - the ML files werent taking proper average scores

I did 5 tasks & successfully migrated us from our CIFAR-10 dataset to VAST images - I am happy with how the ML portion went & I cant wait to have image generation that doesn't use statistical noise

Team plays nice but has 1 issue - I suspect my 3 colleagues are burnt out from all the work. But that or not im happy with their work & we should be fine even if we slow down a bit. I look forward to finishing the term with this momentum (even if only a little)

### Goals For Next Iteration

2 issues:

* #214: image Gen UI - create a UI for humans to get data for image generation
* #213: pseudo data for CNN - figure out a way to generate simulated data for our CNN
