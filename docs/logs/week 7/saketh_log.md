### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
In Task A I was focused on verifying the admin password in the database to check if the inputted password is in the database or not. I got that to work and tests too successfully, in Task B
I went ahead and gave the feature of editing the input details of admin like their username or password and I have managed to get that done and the tests to work too.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * I am going to work on database functionality with the ratings on the image in the webapp.
