### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Created DFDs (0 and 1), modified them after receiving feedback from the professor before adding them to our repo. Created an editDB class to update info the in image DB. 
It is sufficient for now for our current iteration and will be updated as needed as the project advances.

### Next Cycle Goals 
Complete everything required for milestone 1 presentation.
Create methods to query the image database.
Create methods to delete info from database.
Research ways to connect back end to front end.
