### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Tasks 1 and 2 have been completed and merged with master. Task 3 is quite difficult and is going to be moved to the next iteration.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Fucntional webpage to submit ratings.
  * FastAPI merged successfully, or finding another more efficient method for connecting backend and frontend.
  * Additional features and improving visuals of the webpage.
