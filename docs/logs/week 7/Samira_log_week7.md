### Current Tasks
  * #31: Proof of concept CNN - once I had a ton of images rated (see #30) I will made a basic Convolutional Neural Net to determine shenanigans for our next steps
  * #30: Prototype Python application - Make a python file that expands on preview.py - this file should show 1 image & get 1 rating - This will be used for a prototype CNN
  * #39: Append CSV in prototype app - make the app start at the largest n of the csv so no image is rated twice

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

I did 3 tasks, im proud making the jumping point for the neural net was so easy - & I look forward to expanding on my work. My only issue was doing the prototype app in 2 issues - a bugfix like what I had shouldn't have been its own issue, it should have been done right from the start

Everything is still smooth & the team still plays nice. Code review & bugs fixes are also still efficent - look forward to seeing what this team can do

### Goals For Next Iteration
4 issues:
* Optimize the neural network for more accuracy (play with epochs & dataflow)
* Try alternative pre training methods to ensure existing one is optimal
* Try a train/test split to check for over fit
* Make some visualizations of the above issues to ensure optimal results
