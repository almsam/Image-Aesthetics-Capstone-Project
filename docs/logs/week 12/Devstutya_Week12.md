### Current Tasks (Provide sufficient detail)
  * #1: Update UI: After Milestone 1 we knew what to update and where we had to improve, so I tried improving UI to more efficiently  suit the clients needs.
  * #2: Session Management: I created a state of admin being logged in or logged out using useState, and through this implemented session management where only admins can access admin functionality via their sidebar.
  * #3 Create Image Comparision Page: I updated the rate-images page to now compare imagesets which include two images side by side of which one is picked by the user as the more aesthetic image.
  * #4: Fix docker errors: All docker related issues were fixed as stressful and time-consuming as it was, however there is just one small error in initialising the backend via docker which is currently being worked on.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I completed Task A, B, and C as planned. Task B and C helped me formulate what I will be doing for the next cycle, as we need a database of appropriate images for our imagesets which will be compared by users. Task D, we spent almost 2 weeks on, completing 95 percent of the docker implementation, and getting the frontend running via docker. Just one small issue is arrising from the backend connection to docker for which we will meet with a TA and complete within the next 2-3 days. Also, since shakthi, skaeth and I worked on docker together most of the commits are from their github which is why it may seem like I have lesser issues this week.
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Goal 1: Add frontend components for Milestone 2 requirements
  * Goal 2: Update survey for milestone 2 with demographic questions, and extend the image comparsion page with more imagesets
  * Goal 3: Fix Docker's backend connection
  * Goal 4: Implement CI/CD
