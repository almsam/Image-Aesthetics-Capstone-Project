### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I created a class to group images together based on inputs in a json config file, such as number of questions to be asked and how many images in a set (pair, triplet, quadruplet).

I also started on the implementation of the CI/CD for our project. As I have never done one before most of my time outside the other methods i did and the prep for the live demo 
was spent researching how to do it properly and tailored for our specific project. Since I am still working on the research for it. I am still working on this as it took a backseat to Milestone 2 tasks. 

 I haven't been able to do as much this sprint due to illness.


### Next Cycle Goals 
Complete the implementation of CI/CD tailored to our project
Complete everything for milestone 2
