## Sunday (06/10/2024)

### Current Tasks
  * #97: ML README - create a read me file to doccument CNN info
  * #98: Make some visualizations in prep for other bits of data being recorded

###

  * #106: Surrogate data for 3 extra parameters - make 50 data entries for surrogate modeling
  * #107: Surrogate model for 3 extra parameters - turn the data from 106 into the surrogate model array
  * #108: Save tensorflow models so we can be more deterministic

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

I did 5 tasks, I expanded on my work by expanding laterally into surrogate models - its satisfying to see I don't need to change much to make advanced pieces of work. My issue with my work this time was the high error in surrogate model's - I got accustomed to errors below 2 with the normal model, so I was surprised to see high error this time

Team continues plays nice still - good synergy. Green flag is we are comfortable asking one another for help when needed. I look forward to see if our momentum continues after the break & end to end product emerging goes well

### Goals For Next Iteration
4 issues:
* Make a testing framework to gather data from each target group
* Run the tests & gather the data
* Doccument how the neural net works - this will be useful should I need reinforcements
* Make some visualizations using the above
