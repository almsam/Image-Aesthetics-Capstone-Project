### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
For Task A I have implemented MutliLanguage setup including both English and French needed for the webapp however I am facing an issue that is taking some time to resolve, Similarly for implementing docker we are very close and almost done but I am sure we will get that done too before M2. For task 3 with the age restriction checker it has been implemeted successgully where in people under 18 wont be able to take the survey. For tasks 4, 5 and 6 we have worked on it as much as we can but can not porceed with it till our other teamate Zoe works on her issues and merges them allowing us to complete our tasks. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * As mentioned for the Tasks that have not been fully completed yet will be needing my attention before M2
