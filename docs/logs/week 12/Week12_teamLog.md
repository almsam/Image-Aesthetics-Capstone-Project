# Weekly Team Log


## Date Range:

- Week 9 - Week 12
- [3/11/2024] - [24/11/2024]

## Features in the Project Plan Cycle:

1. UI update: After Milestone 1 we knew what to update and where we had to improve, so I tried improving UI to more efficiently  suit the clients needs. Also added image comparision page.
2. Session Management: Created a state of admin being logged in or logged out using useState, and through this implemented session management where only admins can access admin functionality via their sidebar.
4. Backend Functions: Various functions which allow us to fetch/insert data into the different databases have been created. Also various edit data functions have also been added to the backend functions.
5. Machine learning improvements: use a variety of mathematical & data science techniques should allow a much lower error with the CNN.
6. [Add more here]

## Test Report / Testing Status:

All tests for features added this sprint are passing.

## Overview:

This sprint the team focused on making progress for Milestone 2. Now that we're in the final stretch for M2 we have a solid idea of what all is to be done in the next week. This week's features include updated UI, updated and new backend functionality, and session management. We also have Samira working purely on the ML and she will have results by Milestone 2. Next, we will be working on implementing various features for these respective dashbpards keeping use cases in mind. The Kanban Board has been populated with tasks and through this week more tasks will eb added as we brainstorm for the Milestone 2. The next cycle will focus on finsihing up requirements for Milestone 2.
