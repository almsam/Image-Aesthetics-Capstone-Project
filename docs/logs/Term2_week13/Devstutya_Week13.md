### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I completed all tasks as planned in this iteration and updated tests accordingly. After peer evaluation and with M4 completed we added a lot of features to the app. Additionally UI was also heavily updated.
CI/CD had been left due to some issues at the start of our project but now I have successfully automated CI/CD pipelines. Only backend tests are not automated at this point but they are running succesfully and passing.
