I did 2 tasks & finally wrapped up my work at long last, all my image gen work climaxes in the gallery images - portfolio worthy if I do say so myself

Team played nice to the very end & ended strong - we cleared PT2, M4, the final video, & are just gonna wrap up final report before we leave

### Goals For Next Iteration

3 issues: (all backlogged)

* #274: diagonal pixel smoothing
* #275: hexagonal pixel smoothing
* #276: image gen interface
