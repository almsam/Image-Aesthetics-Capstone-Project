### Current Tasks
  * #60: optimize CNN - work on parameters & number of iterations to rinse out over fit in the CNN
  * #61: Alternative pre train structures - make sure the CNN's pre train methods are legit & implement any possible improovements
  * #62: CNN train test split - train test split the data to check for over fit with too many epoch's
  * #63: plot CNN params - make some graphs of #60 #61 & #62 to ensure proper optimization

###

  * #74: readme for app - make a rm.md file to keep up with new code

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

I did 4 tasks, I expanded on my work from last time by optimizing, & I look forward to seeing how this pans out to diverse data sets. My issue with my work this time was I only cut my error down by 0.2 +/- , I hope to do better when working on further parts of this project

Team continues to plays nice, all hard workers. My question however is: code review & bugs fixes are 1 thing, but our end to end product emerging is another thing completely - so I hope we can continue this process

### Goals For Next Iteration
3 issues:
* Optimize the neural network for more data (larger sample size could affect it)
* Doccument how the neural net works - this will be useful should I need reinforcements
* Make some visualizations in prep for other bits of data being recorded - implement RF analysis in a notebook
