### Current Tasks (Provide sufficient detail)
  * #1 : Integrate Front-end and back-end (RestAPI): Research on best ways to integrate python backend and next.js frontend.
  * #2 : Implement Docker: We need to dockerize our project.
  * #3 : Test db functionality with image ratings - Test image rating going to the db from the homepage verifying it via SQL. We will be using a random test image initially.
  * #4 : Implement user survey functionality - Add functionality to send user survey information to the SQLite db, and store it to be fetched if needed.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
For Task A I have implemented Fast Api needed for the integration of front end with back end functionality, I have also completed my task on the integration of image rating feature as well as the integration of user survey feature. I have worked on the implementation of docker as well and we are currently still in progress on it, doscker had been throwing a lot of bugs and we recently managed to fix them and successfully dockerize the project. However,the project is not being run through the localhost link given by docker and need to have a look at it. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * I am going to work on more database functionalities in the webapp and getting docker done.
