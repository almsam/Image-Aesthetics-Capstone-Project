### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I created methods to query the database and delete items from it. I wrote one general method for each that can be used for any table or database to keep the code simple 
and easier to read. I also wrote a method to export data to a csv file using pandas in such a way that tables can be join in the query for the data to be exported.

I also started on the implementation of the CI/CD for our project. As I have never done one before most of my time outside the other methods i did and the prep for the live demo 
was spent researching how to do it properly and tailored for our specific project. Since I am still working on the research for it I have yet to implement it so it is one of my tasks/goals 
for the upcoming sprint.

Everything seems to be going well. Small hitch getting docker to work last minute but it was fixed.


### Next Cycle Goals 
Complete the implementation of CI/CD tailored to our project
Update image ratings system
