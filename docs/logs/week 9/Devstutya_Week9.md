### Current Tasks (Provide sufficient detail)
  * #1: Add admin dashboard page: Using next.js, I added an admin dashboard page where, after loggin in, admin can access all admin related functionality like viewing survey, removing bad survey data, viewing/editing imagesets, exporting .csv, etc
  * #2: Add Survey page and functionality: Routing has been implemented for the home page and the admin login page.
  * #3 Add user dashboard page: This is the page all users will be lead to after the survey where they can acess all user features such as rate images, edit survey details, etc.
  * #4: Update frontend tests and End to end testing: After researching, I chose playwright for end to end testing, and I created an end to end test to check user flow from the homepage to the admin login and vice versa. Also added a github workflows file (.yml) for the playwright tests.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I completed Task B as planned, but in task A and C, the dashboards, I faced a couple issues while using the API to  survey information. Also due to unclean installation of dependencies- which was sorted pretty quickly task D took longer than expected. Task C was done after a discussion within our group and the initial design mockups were decided (which will be enhanced next sprint)

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Goal 1: Update UI
  * Goal 2: CI/CD (and Fix the docker errors)
  * Goal 3: Session management (implement a sign out button too). 
  * Goal 4: Create a image comparision page
