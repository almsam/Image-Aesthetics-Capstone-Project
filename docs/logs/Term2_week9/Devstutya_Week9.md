### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I completed all tasks as planned in this iteration and updated tests accordingly. After peer evaluation and with M3 closing in we added a lot of features to the app. Additionally UI was also heavily updated.
CI/CD had been left due to some issues at the start of our project but now I have successfully automated CI/CD pipelines. Some issues remain due to unoptimised backend tests which need to be fixed next iteration.
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Goal 1: Fix a couple session management bugs and ensure proper session management (Issue 190)
  * Goal 2: Improve UI
