### Current Tasks

  * #2: Admin creds: Admin login is using harcoded data, should use the adminAPI for logging in

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I managed to get 2 important tasks completed but I think I spent a lot of time on task 3, with little success. Will need to talk to a TA and/or other groups on how they progressed with deployment.
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Admin Privileges
  * User access
  * Deployment
