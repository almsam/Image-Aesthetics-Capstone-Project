# Weekly Team Log

## Date Range:

- Week 7 - Week 9
- [16/2/2024] - [9/3/2025]

## Features in the Project Plan Cycle:

1.  Add Image generation page: Created a page in which users can see the generated images via the ML algorithm we created.
2. Add experiment summary/results page: Created a page in which users can see the results of their experiment, which images they picked, and how many users picked the same images (along with a percentage)
3. Added consent form page: Added a page where users can consent or not consent to participating after going through a pdf they havve to download.
4. Backend Functions: Various functions which allow us to fetch/insert data into the different databases have been created. Also various edit data functions have also been added to the backend functions.
5. Machine learning improvements: use a variety of mathematical & data science techniques should allow a much lower error with the CNN.
6. Improved UI and sidebar accessability: Sidebar has improved accessability. Additionally user and admin dashboard have been updated to look more appropriate. Fixed some UI bugs too.
7. Added and improved CI/CD: Added testing.yml, deploy.yml, and build.yml to improve on the CI/CD pippelines we have built.

## Test Report / Testing Status:

All tests for features added this sprint are passing.

## Overview:

Post-peer evaluation and M3, the team is now focused on improving and editing our work to more appropriately fit the needs of our client. Post M3 we aim to nullify any shortcomings we have had for M3, additionally now we will focus on M4 requirements as well. Now that we're in the final term for the project, we have a solid idea of what all is to be done in the next sprint. This week's features include updated UI, updated and new backend functionality, and implemented image generation algorithms. The Kanban Board has been populated with tasks and through this week more tasks will be added. The next cycle will focus on creating improvements for our webapp and nullifying shortcomings.
