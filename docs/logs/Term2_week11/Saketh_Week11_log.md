### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
All tasks are completed as needed except Task C which will be done 
### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Would be discussing future requirements and getting them done over the next few days
