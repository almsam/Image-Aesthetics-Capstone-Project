# Weekly Team Log

## Date Range:

- Week 10 - Week 11
- [9/3/2024] - [23/3/2025]

## Features in the Project Plan Cycle:

1.  Add Image generation page: Created a page in which users can see the generated images via the ML algorithm we created.
3. Added consent form page: Added a page where users can consent or not consent to participating after going through a pdf they havve to download.
4. Session Management: Added sessions in backend to ensure user cant access admin pages and cant proceed to userdashboard without completing survey.
5. Machine learning improvements: use a variety of mathematical & data science techniques should allow a much lower error with the CNN.
6. Added and improved CI/CD: Added testing.yml, deploy.yml, and build.yml to improve on the CI/CD pippelines we have built.

## Test Report / Testing Status:

All tests for features added this sprint are passing.

## Overview:

Post-peer evaluation and M3, the team is now focused on improving and editing our work to more appropriately fit the needs of our client. Post M3 we aim to nullify any shortcomings we have had for M3, additionally now we will focus on M4 requirements as well. Now that we're in the final term for the project, we have a solid idea of what all is to be done in the next sprint. This week's features include updated UI, updated and new backend functionality, and implemented image generation algorithms. The Kanban Board has been populated with tasks and through this week more tasks will be added. The next cycle will focus on creating improvements for our webapp and nullifying shortcomings. We are now also going to focus on M4 requirements.
