This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, please make sure you have docker engine running. If you do not have docker installed, follow: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

For first time initialization:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will take longer than usual as it is setting up the containers for the first time. If you already have installed the latest container, you can dirctly use:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
